Works for a school reports company.

Helps teachers find out how their students did on their tests

gives a string of values separated by commas with test results from schools

would like me to build a simple reports on top of that

What shall this report show?
- count all the grades
"Green, Green, Amber, Red, Green" => "Green: 3\nAmber: 1\nRed: 1"

Other Specs:
- reports should be able to handle case sensitivity.
- When an empty string is passed, return "No Result Given"
- When result != "Green, Amber or Red" add it to the category "Uncounted"
- Only include the grades found in the results in our report.
